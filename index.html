    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      Croissants are French viennoiserie pastries that are actually from Austria
      (Vienna). They are made with a yeast leavened dough that has been
      laminated with butter, in multiple layers.
    </p>
    <h2>Croissant recipe</h2>
    <div>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        1/4 cup (4 Tablespoons; 60g) unsalted butter, softened to room
        temperature 4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled), plus more
        for rolling/shaping 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar 2 teaspoons salt 1
        Tablespoon active dry or instant yeast 1 and 1/2 cups (360ml) cold whole
        milk Butter Layer 1 and 1/2 cups (3 sticks; 345g) unsalted butter,
        softened to room temperature 2 Tablespoons (16g) all-purpose flour Egg
        Wash 1 large egg 2 Tablespoons (30ml) whole milk
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>

      <p>
        Make the dough: Cut the butter in four 1-Tablespoon pieces and place in
        the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook
        attachment (or you can use a handheld mixer or no mixer, but a stand
        mixer is ideal). Add the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast. Turn the mixer
        on low-medium speed to gently combine the ingredients for 1 minute. With
        the mixer running, slowly pour in the milk. Once all of the milk is
        added, turn the mixer up to medium speed and beat the dough for at least
        5 full minutes. (If you don‚Äôt have a mixer, knead by hand for 5
        minutes.) The dough will be soft. It will (mostly) pull away from the
        sides of the bowl and if you poke it with your finger, it will bounce
        back. If after 5 minutes the dough is too sticky, keep the mixer running
        until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remove dough from the bowl and, with floured hands, work it into a ball.
        Place the dough on a lightly floured silicone baking mat lined, lightly
        floured parchment paper lined, or lightly floured baking sheet. (I
        highly recommend a silicone baking mat because you can roll the dough
        out in the next step directly on top and it won‚Äôt slide all over the
        counter.) Gently flatten the dough out, as I do in the video above, and
        cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place the entire baking sheet
        in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the
        refrigerator for 30 minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shape the dough: Remove the dough from the refrigerator. I like to keep
        the dough on the silicone baking mat when I‚Äôm rolling it in this step
        because the mat is nonstick and it‚Äôs a handy guide for the exact
        measurement. Begin flattening out the dough with your hands. You‚Äôre
        rolling it out into a rectangle in this step, so shaping it with your
        hands first helps the stretchy dough. Roll it into a 14√ó10-inch
        rectangle. The dough isn‚Äôt extremely cold after only 30 minutes in the
        refrigerator, so it will feel more like soft play-doh. Be precise with
        the measurement. The dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working
        the edges with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct
        size rectangle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Long rest: Remove croissants from the oven and place on a wire rack to
        cool for a few minutes before serving. They will slightly deflate as
        they cool. Croissants taste best the same day they‚Äôre baked. Cover any
        leftover croissants and store at room temperature for a few days or in
        the refrigerator for up to 1 week. You can also freeze for up to 3
        months, then thaw on the counter or overnight in the refrigerator. Warm
        up to your liking.
